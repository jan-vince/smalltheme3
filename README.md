# SmallTheme 3
> Simple Bootstrap 3 starter theme for OctoberCMS

## Installation

**GitHub** clone into `/themes` dir:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jan-vince/smalltheme3.git
```

## Quick setup guide

This theme is build with [Bootstrap 3 framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/).    
There are some default CSS/LESS, JavaScript and OctoberCMS files ready to be used (or copied) in your web layout.

First **update all necessary** theme settings (branding, CSS, ...) in backend ```Settings > Front-end theme > Customize (SmallTheme 3)```

### Assets

* You should update ````/assets/images/theme-preview.png```` image as it is used as a preview in OctoberCMS backend and also as default preview image for sharing in Facebook or Twitted.
* Put your own ````favicon.png```` and ````favicon.ico```` into directory ````/assets````

### CSS/LESS styles

Default layout file (```/layouts/default.html```) uses LESS styles defined in ```/assets/css/default.less```.    

**Do not edit this file** as it will be replaced with any updates of this theme. Make a new one and use it in your layout file/s like this:

```
{% put stylesheet %}
    <link rel="stylesheet"
            href="{{['assets/css/default.less',
                     'assets/css/my-styles.less'
                    ] |theme }}.css">
{% endput %}
```

*If you need completely different setup (own Bootstrap components combination, different variables and/or mixins), make a copy of ```/assets/css/default/``` directory and ```/assets/css/default.less``` file and setup your own styles.*

### JavaScript files

There are some default JS combiner setup in  ```/partials/default/scripts.html```.

*If you need a different setup you can make a copy of this file and define as you like.*


### Layouts

There is a default layout file in ```/layouts/default.html``` that has some logic implemented (and Custom fields templates for Rainlab Static Pages plugin).

### Pages

There is a bootstrap sandbox page ready in ```/pages/default/bootstrap``` that can be accessed by URL: ```/default/bootstrap```.

*This page is set as hidden and is accessible only when you are logged in to backend.*

### Static Pages (plugin)

There is a default Static page ready that uses default layout and custom fields and is accessible by URL: ```/```.

In backend (with Static pages plugin installed) you can 'build' your layout with some of preinstalled parts (partials) like Header, Banner, CTA, Footer, ...

## Misc

### humans.txt

You can setup humans.txt file content in the theme settings (in OctoberCMS backend) and the file is than available with URL ```/humans.txt```.

*The file is automatically added to page head if you use default layout (or make your own based on it with ```/partials/default/head.htm``` file included).*

### Vendor assets

The theme uses Bower to maintain assets files.

To update vendor files, run command in terminal (in theme root folder): ```bower update```
